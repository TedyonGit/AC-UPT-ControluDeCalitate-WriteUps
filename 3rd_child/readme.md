# 3rd_child

My 3rd child believes in ghosts. I don't know how to prove they aren't real.


I used Audacity to load the wav and I saw 3 tracks, just muted the song tracks and kept only the encoded one. After exporting I knew it was morse code and I looked around for an audio decoder and ended up using this one "Morse Code Adaptive Audio Decoder" - https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html. The visualizer showed the flag while playing the audio, sadly split in two parts but I wrote it down manually and got the flag.
