# Discord

Ah, the infamous Discord challenge. What could it be this time?

- Ok, this was a bit tricky because we thought is more into it, but wasn't. Instead was a bot bait just to throw us off.

- So, like any other team we tried the discord bot that was on the server with the command ``/flag`` or ``/help``, but wasn't useful at all, because the bot was just replying with recipe of some dishes. We even tried to add the bot to a new server or send a direct message, but that wasn't the case.

- Some time passes and we almost gave up, until the hint dropped and we carefully analyze every inch of the hint. Why i say "carefully"? Because the uppercased word "everything" was the answer.
- After the hint we searched every channel, pinned messages, but still wasn't there until we checked emoji and STICKERS.

- In the stickers we found a QR code, but at first wasn't working, so we played a bit with it and we changed saturation, size, etc. And in the end we get redirected to a website with the flag formated in the link.

```
- And there it was the flag :D

Flag: ctf{9096dbeab272bd4d02ea9a5e0f66568ab274b2096f8be3933a48131f8e4db907}
