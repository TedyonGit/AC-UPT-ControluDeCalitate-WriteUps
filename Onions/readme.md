Download onions image, use Zsteg to get an onion link. Once I accessed the website I saw a text formatted with a font, I downloaded the font, I viewed it's hex data and saw some unusual patterns at the end of it. I extracted the unusual data and put it on cyberchef, all the layers of encryption were easily recognizable from start and the order was like this: from base64 -> from hex -> from morse code -> from binary and I ended up with a google maps link. The location had a QR code poster, I scanned it and it gave the flag.
