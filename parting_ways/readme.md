# parting_ways

In the ancient kingdom of the Teutons there was a fortress with 71 noble houses. And hidden beneath one of these houses were two brothers. These two brothers, quarreling over the inheritance of their parentsâ€™ wealth, each chose to go out into the world to seek their fate. But, wishing to remember the place from which each had departed, they decided to divide into three branches. Now the three branches form a bridge of passage between the inhabitants of the fortress. Where did the two brothers part ways? Flag format: CTF{town_name} (case insensitive and ascii characters only)

- If we google maps that location we found a similar location to our current location.

- But is more simillar than we all think, because if we move a bit down the river we see a place named "stausacker", that's our location from the photo.
